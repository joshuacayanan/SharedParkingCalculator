# Shared Parking Calculator
This repository contains a calculator that forecasts shared parking demand for mixed-use sites. Parking demand for each land use is calculated on an hourly basis from 6:00 - 0:00 within a typical weekday or weekend day for each month of the year. The calculator also plots the following graphs:

- Graph 1
- Graph 2

The methodology is adapted from [Shared Parking (Third Edition)](https://uli.bookstore.ipgbook.com/shared-parking-products-9780874204278.php) by Mary Smith, published by the Urban Land Institute.
