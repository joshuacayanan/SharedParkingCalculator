# Shared Parking Calculator
This repository contains a calculator that forecasts shared parking demand for mixed-use sites. Parking demand for each land use is calculated on an hourly basis from 6:00 - 0:00 within a typical weekday or weekend day for each month of the year. The calculator also plots the following graphs:

- Maximum hourly parking demand for each month, line graph with 85th percentile demand
- Hourly parking demand for busiest month, stacked bar graph
- Hourly parking demand for 85th percentile month, stacked bar graph


## Dependencies
- All code is written in Python 3
- Numpy
- Pandas

## Description of files

|filename     |description      |
